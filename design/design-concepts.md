Design concepts

My overall design concept will be of a paridise island environment. My header will have a background image to show this as well as each heading.
My stylings will be to present all the information to the user with out having to scroll. 
I will use image icon buttons at the bottom for those links. I wil implement drop down buttons for some of the link.
I hope to have bright island like colors to bring it all together.
Some inspiration was taken from http://www.csszengarden.com/144/ and http://csszengarden.com/214/.
